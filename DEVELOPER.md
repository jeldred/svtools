# Developer Documentation

This document is intended to provide guidelines for software developers either maintaining or 
contributing to `svtools` development.

## Installing `svtools`

1. From a [conda][1] package <sup>[1](#conda-install)</sup>
2. Using the [pip][2] package from [pypi][3] <sup>[2](#pip-install)</sup>
3. From the git repo <sup>[3](#git-install)</sup>
4. Downloading a github tarball <sup>[4](#tarball-install)</sup>

### <a name="conda-install"></a> From a conda package TODO 

### <a name="pip-install"></a> Using pip package from pypi

`svtools` is based on `python 2.7`.  First you will need to prepare your python environment.  You might want to use [pyenv virtualenv][4].
The creation of the pyenv virtual environment and activation looks like this:

    pyenv virtualenv 2.7.9 svtools_install_instructions-2.7.9
    pyenv activate svtools_install_instructions-2.7.9

Now you will need to satisfy the [`pysam`][10] dependency:

    pip install pysam>=0.8.1,<0.9.0

Then you should be able to install the `svtools` package from pypi:

    pip install svtools

You can spot check your `svtools` install by running:

    svtools --version

### <a name="git-install"></a> From the git repo

`svtools` is based on `python 2.7`.  First you will need to prepare your python environment.  You might want to use [pyenv virtualenv][4].
The creation of the pyenv virtual environment and activation looks like this:

    pyenv virtualenv 2.7.9 svtools_install_from_repo-2.7.9
    pyenv activate svtools_install_from_repo-2.7.9

Once you have your python environment set up you will want to check out `svtools` from the [hall-lab github repository][5].  The master branch contains the bleeding edge version.

    git clone https://github.com/hall-lab/svtools.git svtools_test
    cd svtools_test

Or you can discover the release tags on the repo and checkout the latest version

    git tag -l

when you discover the version tag you wish to install you can switch to that version using

    git checkout tags/v0.2.0b1

_note:_ you can ignore the warning about "You are in 'detached HEAD' state."

OR, you can just proceed to install from master.

Now install the dependencies suggested in the requiremnts files

    pip install nose
    pip install coverage
    pip install statsmodels

Installing `statsmodels` can take a few minutes, but it satisfies the requirement for `numpy`, `pandas`, and `scipy`.

In our environment we need to specify [`pysam`][10] versions greater than 0.8.1 and less than 0.9.0

    pip install 'pysam>=0.8.1,<0.9.0'

Now we can use `pip` to install `svtools` from within the repo. If you are not already in the directory

    cd svtools_test

or just

    pip install .

Finally we can spot check our `svtools` installation and observe the version number.

    svtools --version

### <a name="tarball-install"></a> Downloading a github tarball

`svtools` is based on `python 2.7`.  First you will need to prepare your python environment.  You might want to use [pyenv virtualenv][4].
The creation of the pyenv virtual environment and activation looks like this:

    pyenv virtualenv 2.7.9 svtools_install_instructions-2.7.9
    pyenv activate svtools_install_instructions-2.7.9

Visit the [svtools releases github page][6].  Select the latest release and use the `Source code (tar.gz)` link to download a tarball of the source.

Navigate to the download location on your filesystem and use the `tar` command:

    tar -xvzf svtools-0.2.0b1.tar.gz
    
to expand the archive.  [While you wait enjoy this cartoon from xkcd][7]. 

Now enter the directory that has been created.

    cd svtools-0.2.0b1

Now install the dependencies suggested in the requiremnts files:

    pip install nose
    pip install coverage
    pip install statsmodels

Installing `statsmodel` can take a few minutes, but it satisfies the requirement for `numpy`, `pandas`, and `scipy`.

In our environment we need to specify [`pysam`][10] versions greater than 0.8.1 and less than 0.9.0:

    pip install 'pysam>=0.8.1,<0.9.0'
    pip install .

Finally we can spot check our `svtools` installation and observe the version number with the following command:

    svtools --version

## Releasing a new version

### Tagging a release on github
`svtools` manages its versions using [python-versioneer](https://github.com/warner/python-versioneer). 
New versions are derived and generated from the names of tags in git. To release a new version, all 
that is needed is to tag the correct commit with an annotated tag. Always prepend versions with a 
'v' character.

For example, to release version 0.0.1 from the current commit:
```
git tag -a v0.0.1 -m 'v0.0.1'
git push --tags
```

Next navigate to the github [Releases page](https://github.com/hall-lab/svtools/releases), draft a new 
release using the tag you just generated and add release information (a description of changes made since the last release). This will create an entry on the Github Releases page and upload the release to Zenodo.

### Build a pip package and upload to PyPI
Now that you have a new release, upload the package to [PyPI](https://pypi.python.org/pypi). To do so, you'll need a PyPI account, configuration for both the standard and test PyPI servers and necessary permissions on the `svtools` package. 

These instructions assume you have committed no additional changes after tagging the new release.

1. Build the new release and test by uploading to the PyPI test server.
  
  ```
  python setup.py sdist bdist_wheel upload -r pypitest
  ```
2. Verify that the package appears and information looks correct at https://testpypi.python.org/pypi
3. Build and upload the package to PyPI itself.
  
  ```
  python setup.py sdist bdist_wheel upload
  ```
4. In a fresh virtual environment, verify that the new package installs.
  
  ```
  pyenv virtualenv 2.7.9 test_new_package
  pyenv activate test_new_package
  pip install svtools
  ```

### Build a conda package
1. Obtain and install a [Miniconda](http://conda.pydata.org/miniconda.html) version appropriate for your platform.
2. Install conda-build:
  
  ```
  conda install conda-build
  ```
3. Create the conda recipe skeleton
  1. Run conda skeleton
  
    ```
    conda skeleton pypi svtools
    ```
  2. Edit the tests section of the resulting `svtools/meta.yml` file to look like the following section:
    ```YAML
    test:
      # Python imports
      imports:
      - svtools
      - svtools.vcf
      
    commands:
      # You can put test commands to be run here.  Use this to test that the
      # entry points work.
    
      - svtools --help
      - create_coordinates --help
    ```


4. Build the conda recipe
  
  ```
  conda build -c bioconda svtools
  ```
5. Test your recipe by installing it into a new conda environment. The bioconda channel is needed to pull in pysam.
  
  ```
  conda install -c bioconda -n svtools_install_test --use-local svtools
  ```
6. Verify the install was successful.
  
  ```
  source activate svtools_install_test
  svtools --version
  create_coordinates --version
  ```
7. Upload to location TBD

`svtools` manages its versions using [python-versioneer][8].  New versions are derived and generated from the names of tags in git. To release a new version, all that is needed is to tag the correct commit with an annotated tag. We do not prepend versions with a 'v' character.

For example, to release version 0.0.1 from the current commit:

    git tag -a 0.0.1 -m 'v0.0.1'
    git push --tags

Next navigate to the github [Releases page][9], draft a release using the tag you just generated and add release information.
